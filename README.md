This repo contains scripts and files involving an analytics initiative for McMaster University Men's Basketball, when I served as an Analytics Specialist during Fall 2023. Refer to the examples folder to see some of my visuals (mind you, there are a lot, as these were conducted at every practice) 

Here are a couple of examples (Maplotlib):

- Individual reports (this was made as an example)

- I created this in Matplotlib so the requested colour-code applies automatically when I crunch numbers

- This court location graph was my favourite. I completed these manually during practice or games (a cool iteration would be to integrate OpenCV and have these points collected automatically)

In conjunction with these visuals, I compiled an extensive dataset to support in-game decisions and identify patterns from more data, collected by kinesiology graduate researchers
